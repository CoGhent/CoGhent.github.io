Event stream containing objects from the collection of Archief Gent:

- Old building plans Ghent (OA_535), 1671-1795. The collection contains around 3.400 drawings. The drawings are recognized as 'masterpieces' by the government, due to their uniqueness and rarity in Flanders. Every drawings belongs to a file, which- in most cases - also contains an application form. So for example, we have the drawing 'OA_535_079_04_C_TE' that is part of the file 'OA_535_079_04'. The '_TE' refers to 'Tekening' (Dutch for 'drawing'). The application forms are not digitalized yet, but in the future, every file should consist a '_TE' and '_BR' (referring to 'brief', Dutch for 'letter'). On the website of CoGhent, it is only possible to search for pictures: every user should search on the object number of the drawing (for ex. OA_535_079_04_C_TE) AND NOT on the object number of the file. Some information, like the measurements, is unique for the drawing, other information, like the description, is relevant both for the drawing, as for the file in general. So, on the website, after looking for a drawing, people will be able to see both the specifics of the drawing, as the general file-information.
- Photo-archive of Geo Pieters, a press photographer (122 pictures);
- Photo-archive of Michel Burez, a photographer who worked for the Dienst Monumenten en Architectuur (service for monuments and architecture). The collection contains 3.400 pictures;
- Pictures of the 'Stedelijke Commmissie van Monumenten en Stadsgezichten' (SCMS);
- Collection of Wynantz, 1820-1823: 134 drawings of the city;
- Kriegsalbum Gent, 1915-1916: 606 pictures of (German) soldiers during the First World War, made by German soldiers in Ghent.
- Movieposters between 1938-1961: a collection of more than 9.000 movie posters. The posters are also recognized as 'masterpieces' because they are unique in their kind.
