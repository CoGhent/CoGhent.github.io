## Published Metadata


## Published Collections

The mapping of the available metadata in this event stream can be found [here](https://app.gitbook.com/o/-MaDy7qNCF9HTgoNJPP6/s/-MaDyFunOfBA0nHUQZv_/datamappings/overzicht-velden-datamapping). This Event Stream currently contains **1.237 records** from the collection of **Design Museum Gent**. 
They are divided among the following **collections** (MensgemaaktObject.maaktDeelUitVan):
- Furniture ("meubels"): Middle Ages to Art Nouveau
- Model fragments ("modelfragmenten"): panels and ornaments of wooden furniture that were used to display and teach good craftsmanship
- Household electronics ("huishoudelijke apparaten"): mostly from the Belgian producer Nova
- Objects from the 1960s and 1970s ("jaren 1960" & "jaren 1970"): furniture, tableware, artworks, textiles, ... made in the 60s and 70s
- Italian postmodernism ("Italiaans postmodernisme"): many objects designed in the 1980s for Alessi, Memphis, ...
- Objects from particular designers ("Bořek Šípek", "Axel Enthoven", "Maarten Van Severen")

Art Nouveau and Art Deco objects are also published (with images) but these are not part of a named collection. They can be identified through the object number: objects starting with FH (Fonds Havermans) and most of the objects acquired in 1987 (object number starts with 1987-.
Design Museum Gent uses a different naming for partial and overarching records (for example a set of tableware containing multiple plates, forks, etc. or chairs and a table belonging to the same set). Overarching records have names that end in "-0_XX (amount of partial records)", while partial records end in "-1_XX", "-2_XX", ... depending on the amount of objects in a set. Only the overarching records have images that are publicly available and IIIF-manifests.
