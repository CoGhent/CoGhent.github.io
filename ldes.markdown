# CoGhent Data
## LDES (Linked Data Event Stream)

Collections of Ghent published its data using Linked Data Event Streams. A Linked Data Event Stream is a collection of versioned objects (a version is like an event) and can be updated anytime at their own pace (slow and fast data). This way, consumers can easily discover and harvest the latest changes.

If you are new to the concept of Linked Data Event Stream or Linked Data, [this short training](https://academy.europa.eu/courses/publishing-data-with-linked-data-event-streams-why-and-how) introduces the main concepts.

## CoGhent Linked Data Event Streams

Collections of Ghent published multiple Linked Data Event streams containing information on objects from five cultural heritage organizations located in the city of Ghent: 
- [Design Museum Gent](https://coghent.github.io/dmg.html)
- [Huis van Alijn](https://coghent.github.io/hva.html)
- [Industriemuseum](https://coghent.github.io/im.html)
- [STAM](https://coghent.github.io/stam.html)
- [Archief Gent](https://coghent.github.io/ag.html)

The Linked Data Event Streams are enriched with links to IIIF manifests containing the images of the published objects. 

In addition three extra event streams have been published: 
- [Agent lists](https://coghent.github.io/thesaurus.html) from all five institutions 
- [Thesaurus](https://coghent.github.io/thesaurus.html) (concepts) from all five institutions
- [Exhibition data](https://coghent.github.io/exhibitiondmg.html) from Design Museum Gent.
