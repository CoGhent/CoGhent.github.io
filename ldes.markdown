# LDES (Linked Data Event Stream)

Linked Data Event streams published directly at the source containing information on objects from five cultural heritage organizations in the city of Ghent as well as links to the manifests where the images for the published objects can be fetched. 

There are five eventstreams, one for every participating cultural heritage organization. In addition three extra event streams are published: one documenting the agent lists from all five institutions and one documenting the thesaurus (concepts) from all five institutions, and one exposing exhibition data from Design Museum Gent.
