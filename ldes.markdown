# LDES (Linked Data Event Stream)

Collections of Ghent publishes the digitized and digital cultural heritage as [eventstreams](https://semiceu.github.io/LinkedDataEventStreams/), one for every participating CHI:
- Design Museum Gent
- Huis van Alijn
- Industriemuseum
- STAM
- Archief Gent

The Linked Data Event Streams are enriched with links to IIIF manifests containing the images of the published objects. 

In addition three extra event streams are published: one documenting the agent lists from all five institutions and one documenting the thesaurus (concepts) from all five institutions, and one exposing exhibition data (as well as the objects on display from the collection during the exhibition) from Design Museum Gent.
